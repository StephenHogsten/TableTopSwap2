This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Description
1. User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.
2. User Story: I can add a new book.
3. User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
4. User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

I'll have mine based no board games instead (use the board game geek api: https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_APIf)

# What I want to learn in this project
1. React-router.  this lets you specify paging within a single page app (?)
2. Material Design.  This project has to have big lists of stuff, so I can really imitate things like the music player.  I should make more specifically how it should look / behave ahead of time, and then actually hold myself to that design.
3. Prototyping for React components
4. After it's build I should figure out exactly how it's initially serving the files. Right now I just want to build
